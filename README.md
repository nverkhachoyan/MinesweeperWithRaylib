# Minesweeper With Raylib

Raylib is an open-source barebones graphics library for making video games and applications. 

I decided to break away from writing CLI games and tools and embrace a more fun and colorful approach. It's a breath of fresh air, and a lot of fun to learn the patterns for game programming.
